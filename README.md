## Next Iteration of the Kabeer's Drive platform

Source and technologies here are in a mono-repo, everything here is to eventually replace, legacy version of drive which is still in production.

We're planning on a approach to iteratively update all dependent services and components in production

And obviously the current source is far from ready, basically just lose concepts and architecture ideas, things will clear up a lot as we proceed towards the alpha release
